## Introduction
This is my Project Exam 2 @ [Noroff - School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/).
The website is an accommodation website using Noroff's live API. On the Holidaze website you can view, post and book venues for specific dates. which are built with Bootstrap and ReactJS.

## Project Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## Requirements
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
The API documentation and resources can be found under Holidaze in the Noroff API documentation.
Some of the key user stories include:

- A user may view a list of Venues
- A user may search for a specific Venue
- A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
- A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
- A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
- A registered Venue manager may create a Venue and edit venues
- A registered user can login, logout and update their avatar
