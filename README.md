## Description
This is my Project Exam 2 @ [Noroff - School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/).
The website is an accommodation website using Noroff's live API. On the Holidaze website you can view, post and book venues for specific dates. 


## Project Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## Requirements
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
The API documentation and resources can be found under Holidaze in the Noroff API documentation.
Some of the key user stories include:

- A user may view a list of Venues
- A user may search for a specific Venue
- A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
- A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
- A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
- A registered Venue manager may create a Venue and edit venues
- A registered user can login, logout and update their avatar
